# Dictionary
These files serves as a fun project, Its a basic dictionary which gives the meaning of the word after searching it through the data file( i.e., data.json). This program does cover a tricky thing which is tackling the misspelled words. For that I used SequenceMatcher function to get the probability of similarity between two word and choos a threshold of 0.85 i.e., 85% probability of matching. I have used streamlit to create an interface and deployed it.
You can find the deployed version of this dictionary at:
